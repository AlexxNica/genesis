# Structure

For operation, genesis needs the following services
- genesis server
- tftp server
- file/nexus server
- pxe server
- kickstart server

The test setup is based upon
- a Virtualbox VM, bootbox, which provides all the above servers
- a seconds Virtualbox VM which is the client
- an optional VM for snooping on the traffic and basic testing of the bootbox

# Deployment

What gets deployed?  The web/ and tasks/ trees get deployed
execpt for config.yml.

Deployment is currently done via a git based deploy. There are three
setup steps to get going.

1) Copy the deploy key to your ~/.ssh directory

2) Add this to your .ssh/config

    Host genesis-prod-push
       Hostname genesis-03f648c5.ewr01.tumblr.net
       User deploy
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/tumblr_deploy

3) Add the git remote via:

    git remote add production genesis-prod-push:/genesis.git

You can then do a "git push production master" to deploy from there forward. 

Please note, only pushes of the master branch currently do a deploy /
restart. This might change in the future.

Also please note, deploys are to be considered "brittle" at the
moment, so be extra careful. Make sure nobody is trying to deploy at
the same time, do not hit control-c once the git push has started,
etc.

# Installation

genesis server
- sinatra application fronted by nginx
  - gems: sinatra, sinatra-contrib, unicorn, raindrops
- /var/www 0755 owner: deploy
- capistrano target

# Test Setup

## Required Software

The following needs to be available on your local machine to test.
Download VirtualBox: http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.10/VirtualBox-4.3.10-93012-OSX.dmg
It needs to be 4.3.10-93012 specifically due to client tools installed in the box image. 

Download Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

## Build

Build the bootcd (need to build in Linux with livecd-tools!)

    linuxbox$ cd bootscript && sudo ./create-image.sh
    localmachine$ scp linuxbox:genesis/bootcd/output/genesis'*' genesis/web/public/ipxe-images/

## Test

Get vagrant running on your local machine:

    vagrant up

# How it works

## Overall
- the host PXE boots
- chains to iPXE
- gets menu from Phil
- boot genesis livecd passing parameters on kernel cmd line
- genesis-bootloader downloads stage 2
- stage2 loader runs and
  - downloads genesis-framework
  - sets up yum repos
  - installs base RPMs
  - starts IPMI
  - dowloads genesis task set
  - runs all genesis tasks unless boot "util" mode

## Task
- run all :precondition blocks, exit if fail
- run :init block, exit if fail
- run :condition blocks, exit if fail
- run :run blocks maybe :retries times with :timeout and sleep_interval
