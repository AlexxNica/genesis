Genesis was developed at Tumblr and is in daily use by us.  It is part
of a suit of tools, [Collins](https://github.com/tumblr/collins) our
configuration/asset management database and **Phil** our PXE manager,
we use to provision machines.

Genesis was built to address many of the challenges we've faced at Tumblr
when managing hardware. It has greatly simplified the intake and discovery
of hardware assets.

We welcome feedback and contributions via GitHub as described in the
[README](https://github.com/tumblr/genesis/blob/master/README.md) file
which also specifies the license.

We need your help!. Genesis is still in the early stages of development
and while we've met many of the goals we set out to achieve, there's still
much to be done. If you find a bug or have a cool idea, let us know and
get [involved!](https://github.com/tumblr/genesis/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
