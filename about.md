Genesis was developed at Tumblr and is in daily use by us.  It is part
of a suit of tools, [Collins](https://github.com/tumblr/collins) our
configuration/asset management database and **Phil** our PXE manager,
we use to provision machines.

We welcome feedback and contributions via GitHub as described in the
[README](https://github.com/tumblr/genesis/blob/master/README.md) file
which also describes the license.
